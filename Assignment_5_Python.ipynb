    "Ans--> If a child class is inheriting the properties of a single other class, we call it single inheritance. However, if a child class inherits from more than one class, i.e. this child class is derived from multiple classes, we call it multiple inheritance in Python."

    "Ans--> The Bound methods are the methods defined in a class. The bound methods are bound to the class in which they are defined. They take an instance of their class along with the other arguments as its parameters. Bound methods differ from the other unbound methods in their first parameter."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Ans--> One of the main problems that the pseudoprivate attribute feature is meant to alleviate has to do with the way instance attributes are stored. In Python, all instance attributes wind up in the single instance object at the bottom of the class tree. This is different from the C++ model, where each class gets its own space for data members it defines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a class method in Python, whenever a method assigns to a self attribute (e.g., self.attr = value), it changes or creates an attribute in the instance (inheritance searches happen only on reference, not on assignment). Because this is true even if multiple classes in a hierarchy assign to the same attribute, collisions are possible."
